/* by default in 16bit machine int is signed with values

   int occupies 2byte however this is not fixed as it varies 
   with machine.*/
// size of long int is 4bytes 
// size of short int is 1byte 

//2GB RAM can store (2 X 1024gb x 1024mb x 1024kb x 8byte)

//char by defualt is sign (-128 to 127), unsign (0 to 255)
